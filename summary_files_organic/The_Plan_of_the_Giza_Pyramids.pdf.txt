Here's a summary of the document:

The document "The Plan of the Giza Pyramids" by John A.R. Legon discusses the розташування, dimensions, and layout of the three main pyramids on the Giza Plateau in Egypt.

Main Points:

The arrangement of the pyramids isn't random but follows a deliberate design.

The dimensions and positions of the pyramids are based on the Royal Egyptian Cubit.

The layout was likely planned from the Great Pyramid, the first one constructed.

Surveys by Petrie, Lehner, Goodman, and Dash support the idea of a unifying plan.

Key Findings:

The distances between the pyramids' sides correspond to whole or half numbers of Royal Cubits.

The Giza Plateau Mapping Project (GPMP) and Glen Dash's surveys confirm the accuracy of Petrie's original measurements.

The positions of the pyramid corners, when converted into Royal Cubits, align closely with the proposed design values.

The slope of the plateau was considered during the initial layout.

In summary, the paper suggests that the placement and dimensions of the Giza pyramids were determined by a single, coherent design plan, using the Royal Egyptian Cubit as the unit of measurement.
